A matrix with $n$ rows and $m$ columns has order $n \times m$.
If two matrices have the same order they can be added or subtracted.
All the elements are zeros in a zero matrix.
If two matrices can be multiplied, they are conformable for multiplication.
It is only possible to find $\mathbf{A}^2$ if $\mathbf{A}$ is square.
A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns.
Swap the rows and columns to transpose a matrix.
$$(\mathbf{AB})^T \equiv \mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{A}^T$$
Matrix addition is associative and commutative.
Matrix multiplication is associative and distributive.
Matrix multiplication is not commutative.
An identity matrix has ones in the leading diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
$$\mathbf{AI} = \mathbf{IA} = \mathbf{A}$$
A point which is unaffected by a transformation is invariant.
$(0, 0)$ is an invariant point under any linear transformation.
If every point on a line is mapped to itself it's a line of invariant points.
If every point on a line is mapped to another point on the line it's an invariant line.
Lines of invariant points are a subset of invariant lines.
$\det(\mathbf{A}) = 0 \iff \mathbf{A}$ is singluar.
Singular matrices don't have inverses.
$$\det(\mathbf{AB}) = \det(\mathbf{A}) \times \det(\mathbf{B})$$
Only square matrices have determinants.
$$\mathbf{AA}^{-1} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I}$$
Non-square matrices don't have inverses.
$$\det(\mathbf{A}^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})}$$
$$(\mathbf{AB})^{-1} = \mathbf{B}^{-1}\mathbf{A}^{-1}$$

Area of image = area of original $\times |\det(\mathbf{T})|$.
$\det(\mathbf{T}) < 0 \iff$ the transformation involves a reflection.
$\det(\mathbf{T}) > 0 \iff$ the orientation of the original shape is preserved.
Volume of image = volume of original $\times |\det(\mathbf{T})|$.
A system of equations are inconsistent if there are no solutions.
If three planes form a triangular prism or if two of the planes are parallel, the equations are inconsistent.
If there are infinitely many solutions, the planes form a sheaf.
If three planes intersect at a single point, there is one solution.
$\mathbf{Mx} = \mathbf{x}'$ has no solutions or infinitely many solutions $\iff \det(\mathbf{M}) = 0$.
$\mathbf{Mx} = \mathbf{x}'$ has a unique solution $\iff \det(\mathbf{M}) \neq 0$.
